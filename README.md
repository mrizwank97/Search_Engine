# Search_Engine
This repository is for semester project of Data Structure and Algorithms. We are implementing a simplified search engine. We will not be doing the crawling step because of time shortage. However, main features of our project will include: Reverse Indexing and searching for both single and multiple words. 
It was our semester project for Data Structure and Algorithms course. The main requirement of the project was to make a search engine using efficient data structures and sorting techniques. We deployed our search engine on crawled data of Simple Wikipedia of size about 700MB. We made the inverted index and calculated page rank based
on the frequency of words, title, and headings.
